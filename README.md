# Heroku
This full-stack site will allow a user participating to be matched with the dog that will be best suited for them.

## Requirements
- Make a app that is deployed to Heroku and depends on the inputs from the user to compare their answers against pre-defined array of dogs to find their best match. 
- The user's inputs will also add the user's data to the array.
- There are links provided to the user so that they can see the api/friends array and so that they can navigate throughout the site.

## Technologies Used
- Node.js
- JavaScript
- Express
- Path
- Body Parser
- Cors

## Code Explanation / Demo
- The user will be given a home page where they are given a brief overview of the app and then will click a button to take a survey and proceed.
- The user will click through the survey and will be given a validation error if any of the fields are not filled in.
- The user will be shown their best dog match and be added to the api/friends array of options going forward.
